# ks-demo
KeystoneJS demo site.

I was very interested in using this framework for node CMS sites and apps. So here is my demo site which is updated frequently for new
features I would like to implement and use as a template for future projects.

to run: 
1 cd into demo from Keystone directory
2 run command "node keystone"
3 open localhost:3000
